# eeg-analysis
We make a experiment to determine that the complexity of roads can be affect to the driver's state.
Subjects play driving simulator game in the 2 stages. One of them is simpler then other one.
While subjects are playing the simulator, measure EEG of them. 
This repository is for analysis of those EEG.
